# N-gram-Generator
This repository contains an N-gram generator, a powerful tool for natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis. N-grams are contiguous sequences of n items (words, characters, or symbols) extracted from a given text, providing valuable insights into linguistic patterns.

# Features
N-gram Generation: The tool supports the generation of N-grams, where users can choose between Bigrams, Trigrams, and Four-grams.

Text Preprocessing: The input text undergoes preprocessing, including removal of punctuation and conversion to lowercase, to enhance the quality of N-grams.

Interactive Interface: Streamlit provides an intuitive interface for users to input text and interactively generate N-grams with the click of a button.

# Technologies Used
Streamlit: Used for building the interactive web application.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Employed for text preprocessing and tokenization.

# How to Use
Clone the repository: [git clone https://github.com/attaelahi/N-gram-Generator.git

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application: streamlit run app.py

Access the web interface at http://localhost:8501 and start generating N-grams.
